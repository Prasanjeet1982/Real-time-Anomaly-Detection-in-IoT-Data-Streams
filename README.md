# Real-time Anomaly Detection in IoT Data Streams

This project demonstrates real-time anomaly detection in IoT data streams using FastAPI and Isolation Forest.

## Overview

This project consists of the following components:

1. `data_loader.py`: Module to load historical IoT data.
2. `model.py`: Module to set up and train the anomaly detection model.
3. `train.py`: Script to train the model using historical data.
4. `app.py`: FastAPI application for real-time anomaly detection.

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Load your historical IoT data in the `load_data()` function in `data_loader.py`.
3. Run `python train.py` to train the model and save it as `anomaly_detection_model.pkl`.

### Running the FastAPI Application

1. Ensure you have the trained model (`anomaly_detection_model.pkl`) in the same directory.
2. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t anomaly-detection-app .`
3. Run the Docker container: `docker run -p 8000:8000 anomaly-detection-app`

Access the FastAPI application at http://localhost:8000/detect-anomalies/.

## Notes

- Adjust hyperparameters, data loading, and preprocessing based on your data characteristics.
- This is a simplified example; in real-world scenarios, consider additional factors like authentication and error handling.

In this example, the `README.md` file provides an overview of the project, instructions for training the model and running the FastAPI application, notes about customization, and a license section. You should tailor the content to match your specific project and provide clear instructions for other users (or yourself) to understand and use the project effectively.
